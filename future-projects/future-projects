Some ideas for future projects when I am bored:

* Visual DFA/NFA builder on top of dk.brics.automaton (Java)
  - animated execution of the automaton
  - possibly implemented using GEF
  - or something similar in Python with wxWindows

* Unicode support in (the Java implementation of) SGLR
  - ambitious project
  - will be welcomed by many

* Do something with the Stratego language
  - Lambda Calculus interpreter (not difficult)
  - implement 1st order propositional logic deduction algorithm
  - another idea?

* Think of something to do in (Common) Lisp

* Still time left...
