LaTeX files with embedded figures created with xfig.

Create the figures with

  $ xfig -P -specialtext -latexfonts

and export them as combined PDF/LaTeX files. Link them into the source
LaTeX files by referencing the .pdftex_t files created by xfig.

Run the ./build script to generate PDF files from the LaTeX source files.
