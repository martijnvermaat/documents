This thesis describes our formalisation of the basic notions from
the theory of infinitary term rewriting in the \Coq proof
assistant.
Infinitary term rewriting is a generalisation of term rewriting where
we allow terms to be infinitely deep and admit rewrite sequences of
transfinite length.
\Coq is an interactive proof assistant based on constructive type
theory with inductive types.
The main contribution of our formalisation is an inductive
definition of transfinite rewrite sequences, based on tree
ordinals.

The ordinal numbers are
represented by tree ordinals, following the construction of an order
on tree ordinals by \citet{hancock-08}. Infinite terms are defined by
coinduction. A novel representation for rewrite sequences of ordinal
length is defined, based on the inductive structure of the tree
ordinals. The order on ordinals is then lifted to an embedding
relation on rewrite sequences. We discuss an application of our
formalisation in the verification of a counterexample to unique normal
forms in weakly orthogonal infinitary TRSs, introduced
by \citet{endrullis-10}.
