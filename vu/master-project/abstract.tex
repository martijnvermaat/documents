We formalize the basic notions from the theory of infinitary
term rewriting in the \Coq proof assistant. The ordinal numbers are
represented by tree ordinals, following the construction of an order on tree ordinals
by \citet{hancock-08}. Infinite terms are defined by coinduction. A
representation for rewrite sequences of ordinal length is defined,
based on the inductive structure of the tree ordinals. The order on
ordinals is then lifted to an embedding relation on rewrite sequences.
We discuss an application of our formalisation in the verification of
a counterexample to unique normal forms in weakly orthogonal
infinitary TRSs, introduced by \citet{endrullis-10}.
