\chapter{Introduction}

Infinitary term rewriting, the \Coq proof assistant, etc.


\section*{Outline}

TODO: this is no longer correct (no finitary rewriting)

In Chapter~\ref{chap:rewriting} we introduce the theory of infinitary term
rewriting. To this end we first give a quick summary of traditional (finitary)
term rewriting and an introduction to the mathematical concept of ordinal
numbers.

The goal of Chapter~\ref{chap:implementation} is to introduce our formalization
of infinitary term rewriting in the \Coq proof assistant. We first discuss this
proof assistant and then review the main parts of our development.

Our formalization was used to prove that in infinitary rewriting, weak
orthogonality does not imply unique normal forms. This application is
discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:unwo}.

Finally, in Chapter~\ref{chap:discussion} we discuss our results and draw
conclusions.
