    abstract = {This document is an introduction to the definition and use of recursive types in the Coq proof environment. It explains how recursive types like natural numbers and infinite streams are defined in Coq, and the kind of proof techniques that can be used to reason about them (case analysis, induction, inversion of predicates, co-induction, etc). Each technique is illustrated through an executable and self-contained Coq script.},

@incollection{gimenez-95,
    abstract = {We describe an experience concerning the implementation and use of co-inductive types in the proof editor Coq. Co-inductive types are recursive types which, opposite to inductive ones, may be inhabited by infinite objects. In order to illustrate their use in Coq, we describe an axiomatisation of a calculus of broadcasting systems where non-ending processes are represented using infinite objects. This calculus is then used for developing a verification proof of the alternating bit protocol.},
