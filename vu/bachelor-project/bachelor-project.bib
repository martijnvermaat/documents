  ABSTRACT = {
Transformation to continuation-passing style (CPS) is often performed
by optimizing compilers for functional programming languages.  As part
of the development and proof of correctness of a compiler for the
mini-ML functional language, we have mechanically verified the
correctness of two CPS transformations for a call-by-value
$\lambda$-calculus with $n$-ary functions, recursive functions, data
types and pattern-matching.  The transformations generalize Plotkin's
original call-by-value transformation and Danvy and Nielsen's
optimized transformation, respectively.  We used the Coq proof
assistant to formalize the transformations and conduct and check the
proofs.  Originalities of this work include the use of big-step
operational semantics to avoid difficulties with administrative
redexes, and of two-sorted de Bruijn indices to avoid difficulties
with $\alpha$-conversion.}
