\section{Introduction}

Meta-programming is concerned with analysis, generation, and transformation
of object programs. In this setting, the meta-language provides constructs
to manipulate code fragments of the object language. Meta-languages employ
standard data structures for the representation of object programs. Typically,
these data structures are used to represent abstract syntax trees rather
than textual (concrete) syntax.

The use of abstract syntax allows high-level data manipulation techniques
to be employed in the meta-language in order to manipulate the object program.
For example, object-oriented languages such as Java provide methods to store
abstract syntax trees as object hierarchies and techniques to compose and
decompose these hierarchies, while functional programming languages support
algebraic datastructures in combination with pattern matching (e.g. Haskell,
and the ML family of languages).

Compared to using strings of object code fragments and string concatenation
for the composition of these fragments, abstract syntax representations allow
guaranties about the well-formedness of generated object programs in addition
to the much more powerfull techniques for further manipulation of these
programs.

\paragraph{}

However, there are many domains of meta-programming where the conceptual gap
between the concrete syntax representation of object programs and the constructs
to manipulate the abstract syntax representation of these programs is greater
than one should desire.
